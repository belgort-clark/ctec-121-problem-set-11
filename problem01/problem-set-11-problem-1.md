# Module 7 - Problem Set No. 11 Problem 1

## Tell Me About This List

**NOTE:** READ THIS DOCUMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY BEFORE YOU BEGIN CODING

Ask a user for a number and then determine what numbers in the list of numbers [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] are larger than the number entered by the user. Assign the number entered by the user to a variable named "n".

**IMPORTANT - PROVIDE AN IPO (Inputs, Processes, and Output) AT THE TOP OF EACH PROGRAM USING COMMENTS.**

- Enter your name at the top of the program where it says **YOUR NAME**
- At the top of each program, including a section of comments that identifies all of the inputs, processes, and outputs for the program.
- Include comments within your code explaining what the code is doing. - You don't need to comment every line.
- You must use coding techniques covered in Chapters 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8 in your solutions.

## Instructions

In a Python program, write a function named **largerThan** that accepts two arguments: a list, and a number. Call this function from a main() function.

You must pass the list of numbers to the function largerThan along with the value of the variable **n*. The list should contain the numbers 0-10.

The function should create a new empty list and add to this list any numbers that are greater than **n**. The **largerThan** function should then display all of the numbers **using a loop**.

At the end of the **largerThan** function, have a **return** statement that sends back the string **"Done"**. In the **main()** function, print out the string sent back from the largerThan function using **print()**.
